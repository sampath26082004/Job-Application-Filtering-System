The website [https://sampath2682004.netlify.app/](https://sampath2682004.netlify.app/) hosts an interactive tool called the ** Job Applicant Filtering System**. This application allows users to input multiple job applicants' data, including their name, skill sets, and years of experience. The system then filters and displays a list of candidates who match the specified job requirements.

Users can define **required skills** and a **minimum experience threshold**, and the application will intelligently shortlist candidates who fulfill all criteria. The tool offers a streamlined and efficient way to evaluate applicants for any role.

This project serves as a demonstration of the developer’s skills in building functional and user-friendly web applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases dynamic DOM manipulation, form handling, and basic logic for real-world filtering scenarios.
